# zx_spectrum_graphical_routines_z88dk

outines taken from the 1982 book 40 Best Machine Code Routines for the ZX Spectrum by John Hardman and Andrew Hewson

in 1997 Sergey Kolotov rewrote and optimized these routines and published them in a Russian magazine ZX Forums, edition #4 https://zxpress.ru/article.php?id=5429

The cleaned up code and comments are in the file: graphic routines_V1.asm

This page is a translation of the article to English and placing the code in a modern ASM file.

Additional optimizations suggested by Einar Saukas https://github.com/einar-saukas

Routines are now coded for use in Z88dk with examples
